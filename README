Just a collection of scripts, tools, etc. that I've written, mainly to help me,
but that I'd like to share with anyone else that might be interested.

- scapy-tracehost.py
Wrapper script for scapy's TCP traceroute function. Takes in a single
destination hosts along with an optional destination TCP port, runs the
traceroute, generates a graph using scapy's graph functionality.

- scapy-tracenet.py
Wrapper script for scapy's TCP traceroute function. Takes in a file containing
destination hosts, one per line, along with an optional destination TCP port,
runs the traceroute, generates a graph using scapy's graph functionality.


TODO:
- scapy-tracehost.py
Better comments; possible merge w/scapy-tracenet.py

- scapy-tracenet.py
Add CIDR and range support; better comments
